Climb - A single player card game by Mark Rizko. 
Deck is split between the two colors.
Three cards are drawn from both decks.
One King is removed from the black deck to be the final enemy.

With your 3 cards, try and mathematically beat the opponents deck by playing cards in the right order, seeking card advantage, and knowing math.
The player can attack as many cards as they like with as many cards as they would like to as well, for example, I can attack a 6 and a 2 with a single 10 and therefore
gain card advantage. 

I can also draw a tie, to which you draw from the deck the top cards and if the friendly wins discard all cards in the dispute, if the enemy wins his top card stays but
the challenged card is discarded. 

Friendly Ace wipes enemy cards in play, enemy Ace counts for 11.
Royalty all count for 10, but a King has seniority over a queen and a jack.
And a queen has seniority over a jack. A jack has seniority over a 10.

CONTROLS:

EX:

Do the same for the black.
