PHYSICAL CARD GAME RULES:

Climb - A single player card game by Mark Rizko. 
Split the deck between the two colors.
Denote one deck as the enemy and as the friendly.
From the friendly deck, draw 3 cards in your hand.
From the enemy deck, flip 3 cards onto the table, and remove one king and put it outside the playing area, this will be your last enemy. 

With the 3 cards in your hand, try and mathematically beat the opponents deck by playing cards in the right order, seeking card advantage, and knowing math.
The player can attack as many cards as they like with as many cards as they would like to as well, for example, I can attack a 6 and a 2 with a single 10 and therefore
gain card advantage. 

I can also draw a tie, to which you draw from the deck the top cards and if the friendly wins discard all cards in the dispute, if the enemy wins his top card stays but
the challenged card is discarded. 

Friendly Ace wipes enemy cards in play, enemy Ace counts for 11. Royalty all count for 10, but a King has seniority over a queen and a jack. And a queen has seniority over a jack. A jack has seniority over a 10. 


Score Rule:
End of game, count up all remaining (including cards played on last turn) and +5 for King victory.


TO PLAY C++ Version:
Under "Select Red:" simply input 1, 2, and/or 3 to choose card(s) in specified positions. When finished picking, add a . and press enter. 

EX:

if red cards in play are 

	2	4	6
Select Red: "12. [Enter]" registers the 2 and 4 to be played.
Do the same for the black. 

Objective of the game is to 'climb' to the end of the enemy deck, seeking card advantage and smart mathematical plays and face the enemy king at the end 
with remaining cards.
